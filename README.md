# improvedProtocol_PrecipitationMeasurement
Abstract

This project provides an alternative protocol for measuring weather precipitation. The proposed protocol uses the following formula: (absolute value of voltage produced/area of a single precipitation element)/duration of weather event. This produces a numeric value with the units of watts, though it is designated as RPU (rain power units) for sake of clarity.  This formula takes into account the correlation between variables, such that a short precipitation event with large droplets and high impact force will not produce the same RPU value as a long precipitation event with similar precipitation element characteristics. Voltage, which is directly proportional to impact force, was measured with a mounted piezoelectric component, while an all-purpose baking flour covered tray captured the size of the droplets at the moment of impact. While the RPU value can be calculated for an individual drop, it is better to apply the formula based on the overall average values since it is more useful to look at the weather event as a whole, rather than as individual precipitation elements. Altogether, the low equipment cost and simple formula allow for a greatly improved protocol for precipitation measurement.


Applications

On the surface, this protocol does not appear to have very many applications. However, due to the unique nature of the RPU formula, this new and alternative precipitation protocol has a myriad of applications. 

First and foremost, it can be applied in the weather analysis. Having a better method of precipitation measurement will allow climate scientists to better categorize and analyze weather events. Ergo, the scientists will have a more complete model/record of any events they wish to study.

Another application would be in the field of weather prediction. If meteorologists can provide an RPU estimate for the weather event, people can prepare accordingly since RPU provides information about the weather eventâ€™s duration, intensity, and precipitation elements. 
Although, as stated earlier, this protocol has numerous other applications, one of the more important ones is in the field of engineering. A RPU value is essentially a measure of the energy of the precipitation element/event, so engineers can adjust their projects according to the required RPU strain. Currently, projects are often based on accumulation values, which are not a reliable measure of stress. With the implementation of this protocol, engineering safety practices could change drastically.

While it may be a simple method for measuring precipitation, the new protocol can be applied in many places. A significant improvement over previous methods, the RPU protocol undeniably has innumerable applications.
